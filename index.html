    <!--some intro-->
    <p style="text-align:center;"> Hello! Welcome to my Nail Art Gallery. Here I'm going to breifly introduce two of my fav nail arts I've done last semester as an assignment in <strong>Ideation & Prototype</strong> class. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"> I create nail arts to express stories, feelings, or anything…</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"> My inspirations are varied, and they came from my daily life.</p>
    <h5 style="text-align:center;">Hope you enjoy it!</h5>

    <!--nail art 1-->
    <h3 style="text-align:center;">“Color symbolism”</h3>
    <!--Question: I wanna know how to adjust the alignment of an image. I adjusted the margin in the style attribute to make looks like it is in the center, but I'm wondering is there a better way to do it in html without using CSS?-->
    <img src="week5.png" alt="a pic of “Color symbolism” nail art" width="300" height="400" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 560px">
    <p style="text-align:center;">This nail art was inspired by <a href="https://studiodrift.com/work/materialism/"> <strong>“Materialism”</strong> by the Amsterdam-based Studio DRIFT.</a> </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">The artists take the material blocks that made up the products to build their sculptures. Under this inspiration, I decided to use things around me, and take colors that they have as blocks, to “build sculptures” on my nails.</p>

    <!--nail art 2-->
    <h3 style="text-align:center;">“Latte Art”</h3>
    <img src="week10.png" alt="a pic of “Latte Art” nail art" width="300" height="400" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 560px">
    <p style="text-align:center;">This nail art was inspired by <strong>latte art</strong>.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Latte art is a method of preparing coffee created by pouring microfoam into a shot of espresso and resulting in a pattern or design on the surface of the latte. (wiki) While watching the staff make latte art at the coffee shop, I wondered if I could do the same thing with nail polish.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Because nail polish contains oil as a component, it would float on the surface of water. I used this method to try to make my nail art.</p>
